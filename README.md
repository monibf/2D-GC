# GC2D
A visualisation and analysis tool for two dimensional chromatography data.

## Features
 - 1D, 2D and 3D representations of GCxGC data.
 - Integration and convolution support.
 - Importing of pre-formatted, comma separated GCxGC data.

## Installation

**NOTE:** If you already have python3 installed, you may wish to setup a new environment before running the installer to
avoid having all of GC2D's dependencies installed into your current environment. They will not be removed post 
installation.

### Windows
Run the `WINDOWS_INSTALL.bat`. This will walk you through this installation and install
all required dependencies. 

If python3 is not installed the installer can attempt to download and install python 3.7.3.
Alternatively install it yourself from [www.python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
In theory, any version of python3 will work, however development and testing was done with
python 3.7 so if at all possible use that version. 

**NOTE:** If attempting to install on windows XP, you will need to manually install python 3.4.
Newer versions of python3 cannot be installed on XP.

**NOTE:** If the python3 is installed by the installer, it will ask whether you wish to uninstall python3 afterwards.
Doing so will not completely remove python3. The python3 uninstaller will leave `py` installer.
This can be uninstalled from the `ControlPanel -> Uninstall a Program`.
 
**NOTE:** GC2D is installed to `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, and shortcuts are created in the start menu.
The registry is also edited. The uninstaller will completely remove these changes.
User configurations and preferences are saved in `%APPDATA%` and will **NOT** be removed by the uninstaller.

#### Troubleshooting

- If the installer fails to install python3, try installing it yourself from 
[www.python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- The Installer requires Internet access to install the dependencies for GC2D, if you need to run GC2D on an
un-networked PC, you can create a portable executable on another PC with `WINDOWS_CREATE_PORTABLE.bat` and transfer it.
This will only work between the same Windows version and architecture.

### OSX

If you don't already have python3 installed, install it from [www.python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), 
Python 3.7 is prefered, however any version of python will probably work.

Run `OSX_INSTALL.command`, either by starting it in a terminal, or by double clicking in Finder.

GC2D will now be installed as an App in your user Applications directory and it should be visible in launcher. 

### Linux/Other

For Linux and all other systems with a bash interpreter:
- Install python3 if it isn't installed already. Please refer to your distro's help documentation for how to do that.
- Run the `LINUX_INSTALL.sh` script from the project directory. This should create a folder, 2D-GC, which contains
amongst other things, a `2D-GC` binary. Place this entire directory where ever you like and either execute `2D-GC`
directly with `./2D-GC/2D-GC` or add a link to it somewhere on the PATH with `ln -s /some/where/on/the/path /where/you/put/2D-GC/2D-GC` 

## Uninstallation

### Windows

Navigate to `Control Panel -> Uninstall a Program` and select GC2D like you would any other program.
This will remove the files from `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, the start menu shortcuts
and the GC2D entries in the registry. Desktop shortcuts will not be deleted.

Portable executables do not need uninstalling, just delete the executable.

### OSX

Simply delete `GC2D.app` from your local Applications directory like you would any other app.
User preferences will not be removed. To also remove these delete the `$HOME/.gc2d` directory.

### Linux/Other
Delete the folders you created with 


## TODO

- Uninstaller asks if user preferences/configurations should be deleted (100% removal).
